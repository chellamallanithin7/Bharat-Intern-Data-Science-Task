# Stock Prediction Data Science

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a stock prediction model using data science techniques. Predicting stock prices is a challenging task that involves various factors, including historical stock prices, financial indicators, news sentiment, and market trends. This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how to create and evaluate a stock prediction model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE.
- Necessary Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

### Data Sources

To build a stock prediction model, you will need historical stock price data and other relevant data sources. Some common data sources include:

- Yahoo Finance
- Alpha Vantage
- Quandl
- News APIs for sentiment analysis
- Economic indicators data (e.g., GDP, interest rates)

Ensure you have collected and prepared the necessary data before proceeding.

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data science project. In this section, you should detail the steps you took to clean and prepare your data. This may include handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform an exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. You can create visualizations, summary statistics, and correlation matrices to better understand the data.

## Feature Engineering

Describe the features you have selected for your stock prediction model. Feature engineering is essential for creating meaningful input data for your model. It may involve creating lag features, technical indicators, or sentiment scores from news data.

## Model Building

### Model Selection

Choose the appropriate machine learning or deep learning model for stock prediction. Common models include:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks

Explain why you selected a particular model and how it is suitable for the task.

### Model Training

Detail the process of training your selected model. Include hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques if applicable.

## Model Evaluation

### Performance Metrics

Explain the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance. Common metrics for stock prediction include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and accuracy for classification tasks.

### Visualization

Provide visualizations of your model's predictions compared to actual stock prices. Visualizations help in understanding how well your model performs.

## Deployment

If you plan to deploy your stock prediction model, explain the deployment process. This might involve creating a web application, REST API, or integrating it into a trading platform.
